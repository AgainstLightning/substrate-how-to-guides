## Goal

_What specific goal will this guide achieve?_

## Use cases

This can be general, e.g. "implementing a second currency for users to pay fees in" or specific, for e.g. "a runtime migration from a `Vec<u32>` to SomeStruct ". It is likely that the more advanced the guide, the more specific its use cases will be._

## Steps

_What are the steps that will be taken to achieve the goal? Each step should be action driven, without description and links to other docs if needed. Code snippets can help illustrate the steps but should not take over the focus &mdash; i.e "how do I do this", not "what do I do"._
