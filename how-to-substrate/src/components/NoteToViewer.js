                 Substrate is all about combining <a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/primitives"> bullet-proof 
             primitives </a> and building on them in ways that offer powerful and robust programmable logic.

                The <strong> Substrate how-to guide book</strong> intends to help new 
                and experienced Substrate developers to do just that. By building things up from simple components, the purpose of this book is to 
                serve as a "how-to" guide for developers looking to understand integration techniques of both simple and more complex capabilities 
                that Substrate and FRAME offers.
